# What's a type challenge?

    Type Tetris: noun
    To screw around with a type-system with no practical aim.

High-quality types can help improving projects' maintainability while avoiding potential bugs.

There are a bunch of awesome type utility libraries may boosting your works on types, like ts-toolbelt, utility-types, SimplyTyped, etc, which you can already use.

This project is aimed at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges. We are also trying to form a community that you can ask questions and get answers you have faced in the real world - they may become part of the challenges!
